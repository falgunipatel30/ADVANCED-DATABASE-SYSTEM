# ADVANCED-DATABASE-SYSTEM
Aim: Create Change Data Capture scenario for streaming data changes to various destination DB nodes as sink.

As its name suggests, Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques are used to identify changes. CDC can be the basis to synchronize another system with the same incremental changes, or to store an audit trail of changes.

• Source Database: MongoDB
• Sink Datawarehouse: Snowflake
- For the experiment we have used MongoDB as source database and snowflake as sink data warehouse.
- MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database that belongs in the class of NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases differ from the traditional SQL databases in the sense that they do not enforce a strict table structure. This flexibility and a mature querying layer make MongoDB a popular choice for modern application development.
- Snowflake is the only data platform built for the cloud for all your data and all your users. Mobilize your data to advance your business.

For Further detail explination you can read documentation file.
<b>Out put the Project : - Nosql  to Sql conversion , so basically we try to convert Nosql schema to Sql schema and performing live streaming of data</b>
